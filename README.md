# holiday-box
This is a program that takes an inventory of the cards in my holiday box and a deck list, and spits out a list of other decks that can be played with the remaining cards. 

Right now there are some issues with the program because its pretty basic & I am a casual programmer.
Maybe in the future this program will get better.
